## 🎨 Design Philosophy

We move away from generic "Bootstrap-like" layouts to a custom, high-end feel.
- **Whitespace**: Generous usage to let content breathe.
- **Imagery**: Images are treated as the primary content, not just decoration.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations to make the app feel alive.
