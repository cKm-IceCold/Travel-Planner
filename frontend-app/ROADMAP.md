# Future Roadmap 🗺️

To take this project to the next level, here are the "missing" features we could tackle next:

## 1. Admin Blog Management
- [ ] **Edit/Delete**: Currently, you can only *post* blogs. Adding edit and delete buttons in the Admin Dashboard would be essential.
- [ ] **Image Uploads**: Instead of pasting URLs, allow users to upload images directly to Firebase Storage.

## 2. Enhanced Search
- [ ] **Rich Content**: Use the Google Places API to fetch real photos of the cities found via Amadeus.
- [ ] **Flight Search**: Integrate the Amadeus Flight API to show real-time flight estimates.

## 3. User Experience
- [ ] **Trip Dates**: Allow users to select specific travel dates in their itinerary.
- [ ] **Email Notifications**: Send a "Booking Confirmation" email using an API like SendGrid.
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: A premium dark theme toggle for night-time planning.

## 4. Performance & Error Handling
- [ ] **Sentry Integration**: Track frontend errors in real-time.
- [ ] **PWA Support**: Allow users to "Install" the app on their phone for offline itinerary access.
